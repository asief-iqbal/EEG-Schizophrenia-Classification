## üìú Abstract

[cite_start]Psychiatric disorders demand enhanced diagnostics[cite: 8]. [cite_start]This research conducts a comparative analysis of machine learning and deep learning models for the detection of a specific mental disorder through EEG analysis[cite: 8]. [cite_start]Leveraging a dataset of EEG signals from schizophrenic patients, we employ eight distinct models, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Our feature extraction process involves signal processing techniques, and the models are rigorously evaluated on their accuracy, precision, and recall[cite: 10]. [cite_start]The study aims to provide comparative insights into the efficiency of different modeling approaches in the challenging task of mental disorder detection using EEG data[cite: 11].

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

[cite_start]The methodology for this project involves a comprehensive analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data to distinguish between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with schizophrenia[cite: 70]. The key steps are outlined below and visualized in the following flowchart:

![Methodology Flowchart](Methodology.jpg)

### Data Preprocessing
* [cite_start]**Data Collection**: The dataset was compiled from a peer-reviewed journal, incorporating a patient group of 14 individuals with paranoid schizophrenia and a control group of 14 healthy individuals[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Data Filtering**: EEG data was filtered to isolate five distinct frequency bands using a second-order Butterworth filter[cite: 67].
* [cite_start]**Epoching**: EEG signals were segmented into fixed-length epochs of 5 seconds with a 1-second overlap[cite: 72].
* [cite_start]**Labeling**: The dataset was categorized into healthy and patient groups for supervised learning[cite: 73].

### Feature Extraction
[cite_start]A set of 7201 features was derived from various mathematical functions applied to the EEG epochs[cite: 74]. These features include:
* Mean
* Standard Deviation
* Peak-to-Peak
* Variance
* Minimum
* Maximum
* Argmin
* Argmax
* Mean Square
* Root Mean Square (RMS)
* Absolute Differences
* Skewness
* Kurtosis

### Model Training and Evaluation
* [cite_start]**Train-Test Split**: An 80:20 train-test split was implemented for robust model evaluation[cite: 75].
* **Machine Learning Models**:
    * [cite_start]Logistic Regression [cite: 81]
    * [cite_start]K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [cite: 81]
    * [cite_start]Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear and RBF kernels [cite: 81, 83]
    * [cite_start]Random Forest [cite: 81]
    * [cite_start]XGBoost [cite: 81]
    * [cite_start]Decision Tree [cite: 81]
* **Deep Learning Model**:
    * [cite_start]A three-layered 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented[cite: 85].
* [cite_start]**Evaluation Metrics**: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall[cite: 93].
